  <div class="cols-left">
    <p> Khasakinte Ithihasam (The Legends of Khasak) penned by OV Vijayan is undoubtedly one of the best and most read novels in Kerala and beyond. This celebrated work uniquely blended the umpteen stories of Thasraak, a remote village in Palakkad where the author had spent a year of his childhood. <br> Vijayan juxtaposed myriad human experiences of bliss, fantasy, melancholy, poverty, disease, and death in lyrical prose, without pontification or grandstanding—the reason why Khasak is still an epic in literary history. Khasaak’s multilayered reality is also deeply philosophical - an imagery that provides unique perspectives into religion, language, politics, and sex through its fascinating character sketches, almost all of them drawn from the real-life characters that the author had met in Thasraak. <div class="inset"><img src="./img/khasak-2.jpg" alt="" width="400px" /></div> Deepan Sivaraman, the very talented theatre director, has risen up to the task of creating a visual experience based on this most challenging work and has created a play based on his reading of Khasak. Deepan is a noted personality in the Indian theatre space and is a winner of many awards including Kerala Sangeetha Nataka Academy Award and Mahindra Excellence in Theatre Award. <br> Portraying Khasak into its multidimensional plurality has been a challenge to any medium, to which this theatrical interpretation stands as an exception.<br> Blue Ocean Theatre and NECAB, in collaboration with several cultural organizations,  bring this enchanting experience to Bangalore on the 6th, 7th and 8th of May 2016, at Christ School Ground, Koramangala. </p>

  <h3 class="o-section__title">The Drama</h3>
   <p>This play is a bold and independent adaptation of the famous Malayalam novel Khasakkinte Ithihasam (The Legends of Khasak) by O.V.Vijayan, which acquired the stature of latter-day mythology. The play recreates the imaginary rustic abode  of the legendary land Khasak in the background of north Malabar's village shrines where myths and fantasy still merge together to form the still living traditions of yore. <div class="inset right"><img src="./img/khasak-1.jpg" alt="" width="400px" /></div> The theater setup in an open-air arena on a large rectangular pit of loose earth with  extensive use of fire, soil, water, scent, sky , symbolic use of huge puppets and masks with real feel that allow audience to participate and experience the pleasures and tragedies that engulf in "Khasakh". The  vibrant scenographic experiences  of this play bring back ancestors from the legend of  Khasakh  with their community atmosphere in a ritualistic and  philosophical plane to tell their tales of celebration of life, earth and myths. The director also perfectly knits the dramatic elements of Theyyam - an ancient ritual art form of worship  from North Kerala -into this production.</p>

          <img class="o-profile__image" src="./img/book.png" alt="Khasakinte Ithihasam Book">
          <p>This celebrated work mesmerised the literary enthusiasts by transforming a normal rural story into a magical legendary multi-layered reading experience. The novel changed the space – time imaginations by its profound poetics, knitting of reality and myth, sarcasm, union of carnal desire and existential torment, narrative brilliance, blending of the provincial vocabulary to the body the novel and sublime weaving of sex, guilt and penance. <br> The novelty of the style and content in Khasaak altered the history of Malayalam literature forever and redefined the literary sensibilities of the average Malayalam reader. Khasaak walked the unconventional path of taking the reader through a fascinating history and the existential crises of a people through the experiences of its protagonist, Ravi and the legends that surround the rural hamlet.<br> The stories that Khasaak weaves together using the encounter of the spiritual with the scientific and the myths and superstitions that form the history and the reality of the mystic village make it an experience that you want to go through over and over again.</p>
